### Conference Theme
In today's rapidly evolving world, the dynamic interplay between entrepreneurial innovation and digital governance has become instrumental in fostering inclusive and sustainable growth. The blend of entrepreneurial spirit and technological advancements drives forward-thinking solutions to address global challenges, reducing inequality, empowering marginalized communities, and fostering inclusive growth. Simultaneously, digital governance ensures transparent and efficient decision-making, optimizing resource allocation, and strengthening democratic institutions. This convergence sparks collaborative ecosystems where governments, entrepreneurs, academia, and civil society co-create solutions that drive positive change on a global scale. The transformative power of these synergies leads to greener and more sustainable practices, with green startups and sustainable technologies taking center stage in shaping a responsible and environmentally conscious future. By nurturing an environment that encourages entrepreneurship, embracing digital transformation, and prioritizing inclusivity and sustainability, we pave the way for a future that thrives on innovation, shared prosperity, and well-being for all.
PAN IIM Conference 2023 aims to explore the current issues, trends, challenges and research opportunities in the space of entrepreneurial innovation, digital governance, inclusion and sustainable growth. PAN IIM would also provide a forum for dialogue/discourse for researchers, academicians, policy makers, government and corporate leaders to deliberate on different aspects of management, governance and education.
