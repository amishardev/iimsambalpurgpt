Welcome to Pixel – Design and Photography Club! We are a dynamic community of artists, designers, and photographers who share a passion for creativity and innovation. The club aims to capture the vibrant essence of life at IIM Sambalpur by managing the media database of all events organized by the institute. PIXEL collaborates with other clubs and committees to ensure that no event, whether in or out of the campus, goes undocumented. The photographs and videos captured by the club are then utilized by the PR & Media committee for publications and other necessary purposes. With an unwavering eye for detail, PIXEL doesn’t miss a beat, documenting everything from high-profile seminars to the natural beauty of Sambalpur. Club members are selected for their passion for photography, design, and love for nature. Through workshops and other activities, PIXEL encourages participants to develop their photography and design skills and explore new dimensions of creativity. The club also organizes photography and design contests, both online and offline, and captures moments from Ethos, IIM Sambalpur’s Cultural, Business & Sports Fest. PIXEL serves as an archive of memories in the form of photographs, allowing memories to grow old with the students and the institute, and passing on those cherished moments to future generations of students at IIM Sambalpur. With a focus on creativity, expression, and capturing the essence of life on campus and beyond, PIXEL is an integral part of the vibrant culture at IIM Sambalpur. Email:
