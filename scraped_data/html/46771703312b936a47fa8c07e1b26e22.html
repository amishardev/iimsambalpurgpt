publication opportunities, engaging workshops, enlightening plenary sessions, and roundtable discussions with esteemed scholars, policy makers and corporate leaders in the field.</p>

              <h3>Conference Theme</h3>
              <p>In today's rapidly evolving world, the dynamic interplay between entrepreneurial innovation 
                and digital governance has become instrumental in fostering inclusive and sustainable 
                growth. The blend of entrepreneurial spirit and technological advancements drives forward-thinking solutions to address global challenges, reducing inequality, empowering 
                marginalized communities, and fostering inclusive growth. Simultaneously, digital 
                governance ensures transparent and efficient decision-making, optimizing resource
                allocation, and strengthening democratic institutions. This convergence sparks collaborative 
                ecosystems where governments, entrepreneurs, academia, and civil society co-create 
                solutions that drive positive change on a global scale. The transformative power of these 
                synergies leads to greener and more sustainable practices, with green startups and 
                sustainable technologies taking center stage in shaping a responsible and environmentally 
                conscious future. By nurturing an environment that encourages entrepreneurship, embracing 
                digital transformation, and prioritizing inclusivity and sustainability, we pave the way for a 
                future that thrives on innovation, shared prosperity, and well-being for all.</p>
                <p>PAN IIM Conference 2023 aims to explore the current issues, trends, challenges and research 
                  opportunities in the space of entrepreneurial innovation, digital governance, inclusion and 
                  sustainable growth. PAN IIM would also provide a forum for dialogue/discourse for 
                  researchers, academicians, policy makers, government and corporate leaders to deliberate on 
                  different aspects of management, governance and education.</p>
